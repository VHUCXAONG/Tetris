#CMPT376 Assignment2

## Assignment Requirements
### Basic Part
The implementation met all requirements of the assignment.

### Bonus Part
This implementation expanded z-axis and the moving robot arm which rotates around y-axis. 

Adding new tiles and rotating tiles around the y-axis were not implemented due to the high complexity.

## Game Instructions
### Compile and run the game:
0. Enter the directory (where the Makefile is).
1. Run `make` command.
2. Run `./FruitTetris3D N` where N is the integer indicating the depth of Z axis. Error message will be printed out should exception occurs.

### Playing the game:
1. Use `ASDW` to move the robotic arm.
2. Use `z x` to rotate the robotic arm around y-axis.
3. Use `n m` to move a tile along the z-axis.
4. Other commands are set as required (also indicated in the game interface).
5. There is a timer at the right top corner.
